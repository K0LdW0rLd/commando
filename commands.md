## Basics of the CLI (command line interface for n00bs)

1.    DONT DO THIS: rm -rf / (this means delete everything)
2.    ssh webadmin@1.2.3.4 (gets you into a server)
3.    mkdir hello (make a directory called hello)
4.    cd hello (changes your directory to hello, assumes it has been created)
5.    pwd (prints path)
6.    rm your-filename-here (remove filename (BE CAREFUL!)
7.    rmdir - remove directory, if empty
8.    rm -rf directory/xyz (removes whole directory with stuff in it)
9.    *.php (removes all files of that type in one directory)
10.    man your--program-here (shows you manual for that part)
11.    cd .. (jumps you back a directory)
12.    cd ../.. (jumps you back two directories)
13.    cd (jumps you back to the home directory)
14.    cd / (take you to the root directory)
15.    cd /home/your-username-here (!where you are!)
16.    mv /path/goes/here/filename /path/goes/here/your-file-name-2  (mv moves a file)
17.    cp /path/goes/here/filename /path/goes/here/your-file-name-2 (copies file in same folder)
18.    cp -a /path/goes/here/. /path/goes/here/ (copies the contents of an existing folder into a previously defined folder)
19.    try to put a first letter on the line, then use TAB key and it tries to autocomplete - nice!
20.    find -name hosts (get)
21.    sudo (switch user, do xyz...)
22.    /etc/hosts (where the host file lives)
23.    /etc/init/d (the folder usually the daemon to start programs live)
24.    /etc/init.d/sendmail start (starts mail on server)
25.    ~/ (Shortcut to go home directory of a given user)
26.    Control + C (kills the process on the command line)
27.    Command + K (OSX clears Bash cache)
28.    Control + L (clears the terminal window) 
29.    gzip PATH-HERE - gzips a file for you, which is what phpmyadmin seems to like
30.    mysql -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD DATABASENAME < MYDATABASE.sql (imports a DB)
31.    host your-domain-here (shows you how the DNS resolves)
32.    shift+control+v (paste into terminal, OSX)
33.    chmod +x or chmod 777 (execute permission to make scripts happen)
34.    cd ~/.ssh (see if you have ssh keys installed)
35.    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@host.com" (installs SSH keys - needed for git transactions and other stuff)
36.    source .your-dot-file-here (this refreshes the file, makes life great)
37.    sudo your-samba-passwd-here -a quickstart (changes samba password, allows websites folder in quickstart to appear in mac os x finder)

46.    rvm --default use 2.0.0 (forces Mac OSX to permanently use a newer version of Ruby)
47.    rvm --default use rubygems 2.0.03 (forces Mac OSX to permantenly use new rubygems - necessary to run Jekyll/Octopress)
48.    rubygems and ruby defaults have to be set everytime you open a new terminal session in OSX
49.    cordova platforms add ios
50.    cordova platforms add android

71.    ls (spits out list of directory view)
72.    scp -r /Users/username-here/desktop/source ssh-username-here@ftp.domain.com:/home/user/public_html/dir/destination (scp securely copies a directory from one place to another - the directory on the left is the SOURCE, the right is the DESTINATION)
73.    pwd | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy (copies command line path in OSX - h/t: bradlanders.com) - make an alias of this so its less crazy next time: alias cpwd="pwd | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy"
74.    cpwd (will copy a path to your clipboard, after you make the alias in the above step - aliases will only work locally - YOUVE BEEN WARNED!)

38.   git remote -v (shows you all of your remotes)
39.   git stash clear (deletes everything off of stash)

53.   git fetch (pull all code off remote and puts it into a local cache, updates synced local branches)
54.   git branch --track branch-name origin/branch-name (if you don't have local branches synced with remotes, you can now sync them with this baby)
55.   git submodule update --remote (supposedly updates all submodules from .gitmodules, I have my doubts)
56.   git add .
57.   git commit -m "Updated submodule"
58.   git push --follow-tags (how to push tags to remote - they don't go with your code)
59.   git fetch origin (grabs all the stuff on your remote that isn't in your repo, puts it into a cache of sorts)

## Homebrew (package manager for Mac)

00.	   ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" (installs homebrew)
01.	   brew doctor (tells you whats wrong with homebrew's formulas, whats going in the 'cellar')

08.    usr/local/Cellar (where Homebrew installs stuff)
09.    users/your-macosxname-here/.node (where Homebrew puts node's stuff, if you install via homebrew - you shouldnt do this! Use the node OSX installer instead)

## MySQL Server (assumes use of homebrew)
1.   brew install mysql (starts mysql package installation via homebrew)
2.   unset TMPDIR (run this command immediately after installation)
3.   mysql_install_db --verbose --user=/`whoami/` --basedir="$(brew --prefix mysql)" --datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql --tmpdir=/tmp (allows you to actually use mysql with your user account)
4.   /usr/local/opt/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'your-new-password-here' (sets new root password for mysql on your system)
5.   /usr/local/opt/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h MacBook-Pro.local password 'new-password' (finishes setting up mysql new root password)
6.   /usr/local/opt/mysql/bin/mysql_secure_installation (allows for production server-level installation)
7.   mysqladmin (command to do just about everything with mysql)
8.   mysqld (starts mysql server, but not really a lot of times)
9.   mysqladmin create your-db-here --port=port-number-here --user=user-name-here --password[=your-password-here] --host=your-hostname-here (initializes new database, note randomly unique syntax for password - but of course some random shit like this shows up on a CLI command, amiright?)
10.   mysql -u root -p (opens up a new kind of terminal command prompt, specific to mysql - will prompt for password (another layer of hell for you to wander through)
11.   mysql> CREATE DATABASE your-database-name-here; (at the mysql prompt, this will create your database AFTER you have connected in the step above, don't forget the semicolon)
12.   mysql> CREATE USER 'new-user-here'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your-password-here'; (establishes new user in the DB)
13.   mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'new-user-here'@'localhost'; (gives all sql privledges to your new user)

## Mongo
01.    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mongodb/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents (starts Mongo when your computer turns on)
02.    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist (starts Mongo for first time, assumes you installed via Homebrew and uses [OSX CLI tools launchctl launchd] (http://ss64.com/osx/launchctl.html))
03.    mongod (starts the mongo server from CLI)
4.     mongorestore -h dbserver.example.com:port -d db-name-here -u user-here -p password-here local-db-folder-path (restores DB backup to a mongo server - assumes mongo is installed on destination server)
5.     mongorestore -h dbserver.example.com:port -d db-name-here -u user-here -p password-here --drop local-db-folder-path (Before restoring the collections from the dumped backup, drops the collections from the target database. --drop does not drop collections that are not in the backup.When the restore includes the admin database, mongorestore with --drop removes all user credentials and replaces them with the users defined in the dump file)
6.     mongodump -h example.dbserver.here:port -d db-name -u dbuser-here -p password-here -o output-folder-here (exports DB to a destination folder - note that mongo does not output a single SQL-like file but a folder of .json and .bson files)
7.     mongodb://db-user-here:db-password-here@example.db.server.com:port,example2.db.server.com:port/dbname-here (mongo URI to connect cloud instances - like mongolab > heroku)

9.     mongo --eval 'db.getUsers()' (tells you who is in the DB)
10.    mongo --eval 'db.createUser({user: "admin", pwd: "password", roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "db-name-here" }]})' (assigns user with read/write privledges to db)
11.    mongo --eval 'db.getUser("admin")' (send string of whomever you want to find, tells you about them)
12.    mongo --eval 'db.getCollectionNames()' (gives you a list of all the collections (aka tables) in your DB)


## Transferring things (SFTP, SCP, rsync)

### SCP
01.    [Everything SCP - go here](http://kb.iu.edu/data/agye.html)
02.    scp -r local-path-goes-here remote-user@remote-hostname:your-remote-path-goes-here (EXAMPLE: scp -r /users/your-name/documents/mapbox/export/tile-set.mbtiles user@61.56.90.123:/home/user/mapbox-tiles/tile-set.mbtiles, the -r makes it recurse through the entire folder)

### SFTP
01.    sftp your-host-here (gets you into)
02.    mput /your/path/here/filename.txt (puts your file on the server, navigate to where you want the file first!)

### rsync (the only way to fly)
01.    rsync -rv --exclude='.git' /Users/your-name-here/sites/personal/example.com username-here@you-site.com:/home/user/public_html/site-folder (move a file up to a server via SSH while excluding .git | -r = recursive, -v = verbose output)
03.    rsync -rv /Users/your-name-here/sites/personal.com/ username-here@you-site.com:/home/user/public_html/site-folder (NOTE - trailing slash on first path! this moves the contents of the folder, not the folder itself)
