6.    rm your-filename-here (remove filename (BE CAREFUL!)
7.    rmdir - remove directory, if empty
8.    rm -rf directory/xyz (removes whole directory with stuff in it)

46.    rvm --default use 2.0.0 (forces Mac OSX to permanently use a newer version of Ruby)
47.    rvm --default use rubygems 2.0.03 (forces Mac OSX to permantenly use new rubygems - necessary to run Jekyll/Octopress)

49.    cordova platforms add ios
50.    cordova platforms add android
