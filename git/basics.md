// GIT!

1.   git config --global user.name "Your Name" (tells Git what your name is)
2.   git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com" (tells Git what your email is)
3.   git init (creates a repository of the current directory)
4.   git add your-filename-here (adds a new file)
5.   git commit -m "First Commit" (Commits file with a message in quotes)
6.   git status (tells you all about the git repositories' files).   git diff head (shows me whats different between whats getting committed and whats in there now)
7.   git add (stages changes to your repository BUT does not officially add them yet)
8.   git add --all (stages ALL changes to your repository, new in Git 2.0)
9.   git reset HEAD filename-here (undoes / unstages changes before they are committed). If you dont specify a comment, the system will drop you into Vim (text editor).  Hit ESCAPE key to change modes after inserting text...
10.   git remote add local-repo-name-here git@github.com:jserrao/John-is-becoming-self-aware.git (basically this means you're connecting git to a remote git repository)
11.   git remote add --mirror=push state-blog-repo git@rcsm.beanstalkapp.com:/state-blog-repo.git (establishes that your local is going to push to the remote)
12.   git push local-repo-name-here master (pushes my local up to github, 'local-repo-name-here MUST be the name of your repo')
13.   git stash save (will save changes that are not committed yet, like a faux branch)
14.   git remote -v (tells you what remote repos are connected to your local repo)
15.   git config --global color.ui true (sets up the cool command line color coding)
16.   /home/your-name-here/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (this is where you SSH keys live, youll have to hand the public side of your key to github)
17.   git clone git://repo-url-goes-here.git destination-folder-here (just put a space after the standard clone command to get a nice destination folder)
18.   git clone -b branch-here remote-repo-here (clone a remote branch)
19.   git submodule add https://github.com/user-name-here/repo-name-here /destination/directory/here (puts a git submodule into your current repo)
20.   (FORCE FLAG example) git submodule add -f repo-here directory-here (-f forces something to be added, even over the .gitignore file)
21.   git status -s (does a shorter version of the status thing)
22.   git remote add origin https://github.com/user-name-here/repo-name-here
23.   git remote set-url -add origin https://github.com/user-name-here/repo-name-here (specifically set's the URL for a remote repo, 'origin' in this case)
24.   git push origin master (pushes your code up to a remote, 'origin' is remote, 'master' is your local branch - must setup a remote beforehand)
25.   git add -u (adds deleted files into the commit)
26.   git config core.autocrlf false (fixes line ending errors)
27.   git config core.safecrlf warn (allows git to actually convery CRLF (win) to LF (linux/osx) line endings)
28.   git config --global --add color.ui true (turns git's coloring on)
29.   git rm file-name-here.txt (removes file | directory from the repo)
30.   git ls-tree --full-tree -r HEAD (list of all files in your repo)
31.   git branch (shows you a list of all branches; the one with a '*' is your current branch)
32.   git tag -a v1.4 -m 'my version 1.4' (tags your branch with a version)
33.   git show v0.1 (git will show whats going on with a given tag)
34.   git rm -r -f .sass-cache/ (recursively removes a whole bunch of junk from your repo)
35.   git branch your-branch-here (makes a new branch)
36.   git checkout your-branch-here (switches to doing commits against that branch)
37.   git checkout -b your-name-here/your-topic-here (establishes a new branch and switches to it so that future commits will be made against it)
38.   git remote -v (shows you all of your remotes)
39.   git stash clear (deletes everything off of stash)
40.   git merge branch-name-here (will merge branch-name-here with whatever branch you are on, do 'git pull' on your branch and make sure it's up to date with origin before merging!)
41.   git reset --hard \\[hash\\] (resets git to a given commit in the past on your branch) 
42.   git branch -v (shows all branches, active one has '*' next to its name)
