## Homebrew (package manager for Mac)
00.	   `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` (installs homebrew)
01.	   `brew doctor` (tells you whats wrong with homebrew's formulas, whats going in the 'cellar')
02.    `brew update` (updates homebrew)
03.    `brew upgrade your-package-here` (updates a given brew, like node, npm, yeoman, etc)
04.    `brew link --overwrite your-package-here` (forces symlink creation)
05.    `brew prune` (removes dead symlinks)
06.    `brew [whatever] --dry-run` (tells you whats going to happen before you do it)
07.    `brew install your-package-here` (installs whatever you want via homebrew, be careful when you install node via homebrew - leave npm out of the install and [follow these instructions] (https://gist.github.com/DanHerbert/9520689))
08.    `/usr/local/Cellar` (where Homebrew installs stuff)
09.    `/usr/local/var/your-program-here` (another place Homebrew apparently installs stuff)
09.    `users/your-macosxname-here/.node` (where Homebrew puts node's stuff, if you install via homebrew - you shouldnt do this! Use the node OSX installer instead)
10.    `users/your-macosxname-here/.node/lib/node_modules` (where npm installs stuff if you use Homebrew)
